# BCI system Emotiv Insight
This non-invasive device is positioned as a universal tool to optimize brain performance and measure and monitor cognitive functions; it can also be used in stress control exercises. The software, supplied with the neurointerface, makes it possible to understand and decipher basic mental commands, such as “push”, “pull”, “lift”, “rotate”. Emotiv Insight is also equipped with sensors to detect blinking, winking, facial expressions of a person experiencing emotions (frowning, being surprised, teeth clenching, smiling, etc.).
 
BCI system Emotiv Insight contains 5 EEG sensors and 2 sensors to cover the following key areas of the cerebral cortex:
1)	Frontal cortex (in charge of executive functions);
2)	Parietotemporal zones (responsible for auditory, spatial functions and coordination of movements);
3)	Occipital part (visual function).
To apply this neurointerface, no conductive gel or saline solution is required, since it uses polymer biosensors that provide good electrical conductivity of brain signals.

# Performance Metrics Software
Original C ++ software connecting to the interface via the API, working in parallel with the Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel, and collecting the metrics into a spreadsheet file of instantaneous indicators and proper time counts from the moment of  application  launch.
This allows collecting the necessary data in terms of numerical arrays of indicators without the need to further analyze the bitmaps obtained using Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel.
